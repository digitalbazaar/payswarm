                <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy </h2>
                <p>As explained in the Process Document (<a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus" shape="rect">section 3.3</a>),
                this group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. When the Chair
                puts a question and observes dissent, after due consideration of different
                opinions, the Chair should record a decision (possibly after a formal vote) and any objections, and move on. </p>
                
                <p>This charter is written in accordance with <a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">Section 3.4,
               Votes</a> of the W3C Process Document and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document
               requires. </p>
