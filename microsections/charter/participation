                <p>To be successful, the PaySwarm Working Group is expected to have 5 or
                more active participants for its duration. Effective participation in the PaySwarm
                Working Group is expected to consume one work day per week for each
                participant; two days per week for editors. The PaySwarm Working Group will
                also allocate the necessary resources for building proof-of-concept
                Implementations, Test Suites, and reviews for
                each specification. </p>
                <p>Participants are reminded of the <a href="/2005/10/Process-20051014/groups.html#good-standing">Good
