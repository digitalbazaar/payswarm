<h2>Ad-Based Content Payment</h2>

<p>
Joss directs and produces a number of excellent television shows.
Over the years, he has garnered a strong online following but doesn't have
the required numbers for a long television production run. 
He would like to distribute his shows via the Web. Joss
would like to partner with an advertising network to provide audio and 
video advertisements to cover the costs related to the production and 
distribution of his shows. In order to do this, the system that he uses
must be able to credit and debit payment accounts accordingly whenever
advertising is inserted into the content stream.
</p>

<p>
When a fan watches each episode, they can opt to pay for the episode in
full, pay for reduced advertisements, or request that advertisers cover
the entire cost of the show. Advertisers can choose to provide small payments
for anonymous advertisements, or larger payments if customers provide
advertising details and preferences to the advertisers.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>Network participants should be allowed to credit other accounts on the network. For example, buyers should be allowed to ask other network participants (advitisers) to partially cover their costs in exchange for the insertion of ads into the data stream.</li>
</ul>
