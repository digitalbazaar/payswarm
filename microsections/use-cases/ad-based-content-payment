<h2>Ad-Based Content Payment</h2>

<p>
Joss directs and produces a number of really great television shows and has 
a strong
online following. He would like to distribute his shows via the Web. Joss
would like to partner with an advertising network to provide audio and 
video advertisements to cover the costs related to the production and 
distribution of his shows. In order to do this, the system that he uses
must be able to credit and debit payment accounts accordingly whenever
advertising is inserted into the content stream.
