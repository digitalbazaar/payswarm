<h2>Batching Micropayments</h2>

<p>
Penelope has completed her fourth book of photography. She would like to
charge a very small amount for her travel expenses and supplies but
doesn't want to make a living from the sale of her book. Penelope does,
however, want to make a number of contributions
to charities that she would like to support as well as give her fans the
ability to contribute to their favorite charities.

Giving individuals on the network the ability to add optional payees
to licenses and contracts would enable payment models such as 
online tipping for artists, donations to charity, and batched payments
to a particular initiative or cause to be made along-side the purchase.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>Network participants must be allowed to add arbitrary accounts as
payees for transactions.</li>
<li>A large number of payment accounts must be allowed to be batched with content transactions.</li>
