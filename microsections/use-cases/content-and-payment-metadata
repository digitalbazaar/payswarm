<h2>Content and Payment Metadata</h2>

<p>
Lars would like to ensure that the purchase process for a digital good is 
streamlined as much as possible into the web browser that he has created. When
somebody uses the web browser, he would like to display a "Buy" button in
the address bar. The media details such as the title of
the work, the price and the details required to perform a swarming purchase
would be lifted from the web page.
</p>

<p>
The purchase process would be as simple as the buyer clicking the Buy button 
and watching a download progress dialog appear on the screen. Account and
payment details could be stored in the web browser to ease the purchase
process. Not bothering the person browsing for payment details would be 
especially useful in scenarios where very small payments were needed to 
access content.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>Content details should be able to be expressed in a Web page such that a user agent can extract the details for a piece of digital content.</li>
<li>All relevant payment details should be expressed in a Web page such that a user agent may purchase content after detecting the payment processing details on a page.</li>
</ul>
