<h2>Content and Payment Metadata</h2>

<p>
Lars would like to ensure that the purchase process for a digital good is 
streamlined as much as possible into the web browser that he has created. When
somebody uses his web browser, he'd like a "Buy" button with the title of
the work, the price and the details required to perform a swarming purchase
to be lifted from the web page. The purchase process would be as simple as
the buyer clicking the Buy button and watching a download progress dialog
appear on the screen.
