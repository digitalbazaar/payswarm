<h2>Crowd-Sourcing Digital Distribution</h2>

<p>
Jane, who is an independent film maker, has just finished her documentary
and wishes to distribute it to a very large audience. She does not have
the resources to provide High-Definition streaming of her content to her
fans. She would also like to charge enough for the current documentary 
in order to cover the production costs of the next documentary. She could
use BitTorrent to distribute her work, but it lacks the ability to collect
payment on her behalf. She would like to give some of the proceeds of each
sale to those that will help her distribute her documentary.
