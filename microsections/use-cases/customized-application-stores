<h2>Customized Application Stores</h2>

<p>
Werner owns an independent software development company. He would like to 
provide his software application to a broad audience while
ensuring that it is uniquely tailored to each of his customers. He has
experience writing code and would like every application package that
is distributed to have a unique customer key embedded in the installation
program for the purposes of providing customer support to those that 
have received software keys. The purchaser's information could also
be filled out automatically in the software registration screen for the
software at the time of purchase.

Having a binary stream processor would enable customized data files
to be sold on the network. The most difficult aspect of the binary stream
processor would be ensuring that the stream processor's ABI was compatible
across major processing architectures as well as remotely executable. There
are a number of security concerns that are also related with executing
arbitrary code to mutate data streams. It may be required that binary
stream processors must undergo a code-review before they are allowed on
the network.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>A binary stream processing component should be allowed as a part of the purchase process in order to allow custom binaries to be transacted on the network. </li>
<li>The binary stream processor should be able to be downloaded and executed by all components of the PaySwarm network.</li>
<li>Digital signatures and binary verification may be required for binary stream processors.</li>
</ul>
