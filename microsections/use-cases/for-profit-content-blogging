<h2>For-Profit Content Blogging</h2>

<p>
Jude blogs about music and movies and has achieved a respectable following
of people that read his blog. He would like to sell content that he
writes about to his many readers, but doesn't have the music and movie 
industry
connections to acquire content for distribution. Typically, content deals
require an multi-million dollar, advance payment in return for the
right to sell content. This high up-front cost removes many potential
sellers, harming the overall incentive to distribute for people that run
smaller music websites and blogs.

<p>
There are many existing clearing houses for content on the web today. If
those clearing houses were able to manage artist content,
content creators could use the clearing house to setup the distribution
rights for their content. Smaller content distributors, like Jude, could then
offer content to their site visitors without worrying about the high-cost
or management overhead associated with managing content catalogs.
