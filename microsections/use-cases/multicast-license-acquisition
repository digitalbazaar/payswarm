<h2>Multicast License Acquisition</h2>

<p>
The Association of Science Journalists Conference would like to present a 
series of
live keynotes by luminaries in their respective fields. The presentations
would be open to conference attendees or those that pay for a virtual
day pass for the conference. The license could be purchased separately and
then could be used to access a number of multicast sources that play at
different times. Remote access to journalists would be granted at a 
different payment rate than non-members.
</p>

<p>
It is important that a separation is made between the content license
and the download contract. The content license specifies usage and
access rights. The download contract specifies the download negotiables, 
such as payment rate, speed and other details associated with the data stream.
By separating the two concerns, we can allow network specialization to
occur between those that would grant licenses for digital content and
those that would deliver digital content. Ensuring that both could 
operate semi-autonomously would allow semi-independent optimization of 
market variables.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The system must be able to distinguish between licenses and contracts
for data delivery. One should be able to purchase the license and then
have the option of choosing their download source. Content licenses
and data delivery contract should be able to be negotiated separately.</li>
<li>Licenses should be used to get access to data streams. Payment for
licenses and payment for data should be separate concerns.</li>
<li>Accessing payment-based multicast streams should be possible with whatever technology solution is created.</li>
</ul>
