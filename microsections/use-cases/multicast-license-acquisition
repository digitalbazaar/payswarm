<h2>Multicast License Acquisition</h2>

<p>
The Association of Science Journals Conference would like to present a series of
live keynotes by luminaries in their respective fields. The presentation
would be open to conference attendees or those that pay for a virtual
day pass for the conference. The license could be purchased separately and
then could be used to access a number of multicast sources that play at
different times.
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>The system must be able to distinguish between licenses and contracts
for data delivery. One should be able to purchase the license and then
have the option of choosing their download source. Content licenses
and data delivery contract should be able to be negotiated separately.</li>
<li>Licenses should be used to get access to data streams. Payment for
licenses and payment for data should be separate concerns.</li>
<li>Accessing payment-based multicast streams should be possible with whatever technology solution is created.</li>
</ul>
