<h2>Price Negotiation</h2>

<p>
Gregor runs a fairly active high-definition movie download site. 
His data transmission prices are high during peak hours and low during 
off-peak hours. He would like to give his customers the option to negotiate for
lower download prices if they download their movies during the off-peak
times. He would also like to reserve the right to refuse a contract
re-negotiation attempt if he has not made a pre-set sales quota and even
raise his prices if it would make sense for his business.

<p>
The ability to change prices based on market demand would enable
a more dynamic marketplace, leading to more competition between download
providers. Giving buyers the ability to re-negotiate terms of sale would
not only give them a sense of empowerment, but could eliminate bad
pricing behavior on the network, leading to overall market efficiencies.
