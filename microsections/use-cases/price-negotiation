<h2>Price Negotiation</h2>

Gregor runs a fairly active high-definition movie download site. 
His data transmission prices are high during the day and low during the 
night. He would like to give his customers the option to negotiate for
lower download prices if they download their movies during the night
time. He would also like to reserve the right to refuse a contract
re-negotation attempt.
