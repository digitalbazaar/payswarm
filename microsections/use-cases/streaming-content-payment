<h2>Streaming Content Payment</h2>

<p>
Tellulah is a DJ and would like to setup a non-profit Internet radio 
station to stream Weekly Top 40 songs along with a mix of 
independent music. She would like to cover her expenses as well as
the standard per-song ephemeral broadcasting fee set by the US Copyright
Arbitration Panel to ensure she is legally compliant at all times. Registering
and tracking royalties can be a very daunting and time consuming process.
A mechanism that reduces the burden of legal compliance could drive more
stations to come online.

<p>
Online radio broadcasters are also presently limited in their ability to grow
their stations due to the ephemeral broadcasting royalties that must be
paid on a per person/per song basis. Running these stations make it
difficult to collect, track and distribute royalties in a way that makes
it easy to integrate into the web browser. Often, donating or signing up
to a single download provider can be more trouble than it is worth. If
there was a universal mechanism to pay very small amounts for data streams 
on the Web, new legal avenues for distributing content legally would be 
enabled.

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>Payment must be able to be associated with a section of a stream of data. Payment should be allowed to be associated with a particular number of bytes or temporal time frame.</li>
<li>Small fractions of whole currency amounts should be allowed in order to ensure accurate metering and payment recouping for content streams.</li>
</ul>
